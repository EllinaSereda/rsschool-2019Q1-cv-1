I don't have a lot of experience in coding of serious projects, but I have a big passion to learn and ready to work hard to get the best coding skills.
I'm getting acquainted with new tools from the first time (at least I think so).
I never been involved in code learning schools or something like that. 
I most-likely prefer to study by myself. 
So, I know how to work with Photoshop-like tools and have been working with it for about six years.
Recently, I made my first layout for a website. I also wrote HTML-code and CSS for that. 
It was my first coding experience ever and I liked it very much.
I very like to read programming and coding topics, and I very enjoy to be involved in the learning process. 
I like to see a result of my work.
